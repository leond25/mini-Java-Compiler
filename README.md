# Mini Java Compiler
This project is a Mini Java Compiler, a simplified version of a Java compiler that parses and compiles Mini Java programs. Mini Java is a subset of the Java programming language, designed for educational purposes and to introduce compiler construction.
Mini Java is a simplified version of Java, focusing on the core features of the language. It omits many of the more complex features of full Java, making it easier to analyze and compile. Mini Java is often used in academic settings to teach compiler construction and programming language principles.
## Features
- Lexical analysis
- Syntax analysis (parsing)
- Semantic analysis
- Intermediate code generation
