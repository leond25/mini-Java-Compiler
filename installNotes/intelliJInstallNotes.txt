The project installation process for Intellij is essentially identical
to that of Assignments 3 and 4, except that the following should be
dragged to the main project folder:
- the same things as for Assignments 3 and 4:
  - the jars folder
  - the lib folder
  - the sample MiniJava files (e.g., BreakYe.java, etc.)
- and additionally, the runtime library asm-files:
  - mjLib.asm
  - mjLibAnn.asm

Additionally, all files and folders in the 'src' folder (but not the 'src'
folder itself) should be dragged into the 'src' folder in the project

================================================================
Running your MiniJava compiler
================================================================
- press triangle to open 'src' folder in left pane
- press triangle to open 'main' folder in left pane
- right-click (or on Mac, control-click) on 'Main5' class icon
  menu: (green triangle) Run 'Main5.main()'

First time run of the project, it should fail giving console message:
  No input file name given
To add the input file name:
  - menu: Run -> Edit Configurations ...
  - 'Configuration' tab
  - Program arguments should be something like:
        VerySimple.java -a mjLib.asm
    - if you want to, you can also include a -w or -pp on the command line
    - if you want the "annotating" version of the MiniJava library use
      arguments such as:
          VerySimple.java -a mjLibAnn.asm
  - press 'OK'
To rerun program, can do any of:
- type control-R
- press green triangle near top-right of window
- menu item Run -> Run 'Main5'

Running the compiler should produce an assembly file (e.g., VerySimple.asm).

The starter-file project will:
  - produce the vtables
  - produce exacly one assembly-level image for each string literal in the
    source program. (It will not produce exactly one image for every UNIQUE
    string literal, as it should.)
  - produce a 'main' label, with code that does a syscall that
    immediately exits
You should therefore be able to successfully assemble and run the code,
but the MIPS code will, in effect, do nothing other than immediately exit.

================================================================
Running the generated code on the MIPS simulator
================================================================
- drag your VerySimple.asm file to a folder containing the MIPS simulator
  (mips.bat and mips.jar, or similarly named jar file).
- on a PC, drag the new copy of your VerySimple.asm file onto the mips.bat
  icon.
- on a Mac (or if this does not work on a PC), double-click on MIPS
  jar-file, and type in the name of your file, Abc.asm
- the simulator should start running, allowing you run/debug the
  assembly program

================================================================
To run a MiniJava program in standard Java
================================================================
- copy the MiniJava file you want to run into the 'src' folder
- right-click (or on a Mac, control-click) on 'RunMain'; choose
  Run 'RunMain().main()'
  - if this causes an "duplicate class name 'Main'" error, delete the
    existing MiniJava file (or comment out or rename its Main class)
